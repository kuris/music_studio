"""Long-lived YuE2 worker for native front ends: JSON lines in on stdin, JSON events out on stdout.

Songs are processes, the GPU and the Neural Engine are resources, and one scheduler assigns
resources to songs by priority (the order the songs were added). See ``Scheduler.schedule`` for
the whole policy; in short:

  Neural Engine   the highest-priority song that wants it, including a song already solving on
                  the GPU, which moves across mid-solve if it outranks everything waiting.
  GPU, tokenizing the highest-priority queued song, taking every other queued song of the same
                  kind along in one batch (one row or four cost the same per step).
  GPU, synthesis  drafts, and full-quality songs while the Neural Engine is busy. A queued song
                  that outranks the song synthesizing on the GPU starts its batch and the
                  synthesis pauses between steps until the GPU is free again.
  Rendering       always admitted: its tiles interleave with token steps.
